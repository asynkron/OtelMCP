# `collector/trace/v1` Context

- `trace_service.proto` defines the `TraceService` gRPC contract (`Export`, streaming APIs) used by the receiver's [`TraceServiceImpl`](../../../../../../Asynkron.OtelReceiver/Services/TraceServiceImpl.cs).

Keep this file aligned with the upstream OTLP spec; regenerate gRPC stubs when updating.
